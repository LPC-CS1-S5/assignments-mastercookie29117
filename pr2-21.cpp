// Write a program that calculates and displays an employee’s total wages for the week.

// The regular hours for the work week are 40,
// and any hours worked over 40 are considered overtime.
// The employee earns $18.25 per hour for regular hours and $27.78 per hour for overtime hours.
// The employee has worked 50 hours this week.
 

// Make the pseudocode algorithm shows the program’s logic.

// Pseudocode

// Regular wages = base pay rate × regular hours
// Overtime wages = overtime pay rate × overtime hours
// Total wages = regular wages + overtime wages
// Display the total wages
